# CS323 Project2 Report: Semantic Analysis 

11610303 黄玉安

### Introduction

Base on Project 1, I add more code to do the semantic analysis, for project 1, I only get a parse tree, so in this project, I need to convert it to a abstract syntax tree. The process is also included in the bison part.

For example, generate a function node for AST.

```c++
FunDec: ID LP VarList RP {
                $$ = make_parent($1, "FunDec");
                add_childs($$, $2);
                add_childs($$, $3);
                add_childs($$, $4);
		Function* func = new Function($1, $3);
		$$->baseNode = func;
         
```

```c++
Function::Function(AttrNode *functionID, AttrNode *paraList) {
    this->id = functionID->value;
    setLocation(new Location(functionID->lineNo, 0));
    this->flag = FUNC;
    parseParameters(paraList);
}
```

After parsing, I will analyze this AST, the scope checking and type checking will be followed.

### Analysis Flow

The entrance for my program is in the driver.cpp, it will invoke function`semantic_analysis` to do the following action.

```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv){
    AttrNode* parse_tree_root = get_parse_tree(argc, argv);
    if(parse_tree_root== nullptr){
        return 1;
    }
    show_syntax_tree(parse_tree_root);
    AST* ast = (AST*)parse_tree_root->baseNode;
    ErrorHandler* handler = semantic_analysis(*ast);

    handler->showError(std::cerr);

    delete(ast);
    delete(handler);
    free_AttrNode(parse_tree_root);
}
```

Here is how I analyze it.

```c++
ErrorHandler* semantic_analysis(AST &ast) {
    ErrorHandler* h = new ErrorHandler();
    TypeTable *typeTable = new TypeTable;

    LocalResolver local(*h, typeTable);
    TypeResolver typeResolver(*h, typeTable);
    TypeChecker typeChecker(*h, typeTable);

    local.resolve(ast);
    typeResolver.resolve(ast);
    //check recursive definition
    typeTable->checkRecursiveDefinition(*h);
    if (!h->errorOccured()) {
        typeChecker.resolve(ast);
    }
    ast.setTypeTable(typeTable);
    return h;
}
```

- First, it will check the scope, find the reference variable for all the statement, `LocalResolver` is for doing this job.

- Second, `TypeResolver` will found the reference type for each variable type, it is mainly for struct, some times, it is not complete, for example, `struct A a`, no one knows what A has, so `TypeResolver` will found its complete definition.

- Third, after doing above two job, the `TypeTable` need to check is there exist some recursive definition such as:

    ```c
    struct A{
        struct B b;
    }; 
    struct B{
        struct A a;
    };
    ```

- Last thing is type checking.

Only the above test was passed, the program will do the following type checking. So the is the reason why my program usually will **ignore the follow error** when I found one error in one expression. Because if there are some error occurred, following check may be dangerous, compiler may be crash.

For example, if there are recursive definition for `STRUCT`, when I check **struct equivalence**, it may enter infinite loop.

Another reason is that multiple error message for one expression may be ambiguous for user since in most case, there are only one error occurred.

Finally, I pass all the test and I also implement some bonus features.

### Optional Features

#### 1. Could have any scope, shadow previous scope variable definition

It is done by the symbol table, my symbol table is a tree structure, see `src/scope.h`, so it could handle any scope, shadow previous scope variable definition

#### 2. Structure equivalence

I could deal with structure equivalence. The process is very complex.

```c++
bool checkStructEquivalence(Struct *st1, Struct *st2) {
    list<Variable *>& members1 = st1->getMemberList();
    list<Variable *>& members2 = st2->getMemberList();
    if (members1.size() != members2.size()) {
        return false;
    }
    auto var1 = members1.begin();
    auto var2 = members2.begin();
    while (var1 != members1.end()) {
        if (!checkEqualVariable(*var1, *var2)) {
            return false;
        }
        var1++;
        var2++;
    }
    return true;
}
```

When invoke function `checkEqualVariable`, if there members contains struct type, it may invoke `bool checkStructEquivalence(Struct *st1, Struct *st2)` again, it is a recursive checking process.

 

### Bonus Features:

There are several features I implement, also  you can use `make test` to check all of these test.

#### 1. Detect recursive definition for multiple `struct` type

I could detect if there exist recursive definition for struct type, like the following example

```c
struct A
{
  int name;
  struct B b;
};

struct B
{
  int name;
  struct A a;
};

struct Person
{
  int name;
  struct Person p;
  int friends[10];
};
```

the test is in: `b_recursive_struct_member.spl`

#### 2. Could detect overlapped field in a `struct`

```c
struct Person
{
  int name;
  float name;
  int friends[10];
};
```

The test is in: `b_overlapped_fields.spl`

#### 3. Arithmetic, comparing and assign support between float and int

Can do arithmetic and comparing between float and int.

Can assign int to float type variable, but can not assign float to int type variable.

see test: `b_float_and_int.spl`

#### 4. Set only `bool` type can be condition of if and while statement

can not use a int or float to condition of if and while statements, comparing result of expression will be change to bool type.

see test: `b_bool.spl`

#### 5. Could detect  Arithmetic operation between non-float or non-int

Only number(float and int) could do Arithmetic operation 

see `b_non_number_arithmetic.spl`

#### 6. Support multi dimension array

The array's dimension could more than 1, there will be type checking for operation of them.

see test `b_multi_array.spl`

#### 7. Support incomplete `struct`

It can deal with use the struct type before define the struct as long as it defined this structure finally

```c
struct A
{
  int name;
  struct B b;
};

struct B
{
  int name;
};
```

The test is in: `b_incomplete_struct.spl`
