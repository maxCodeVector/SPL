# CS323 Project 3 Report: Intermediate Code Generation

11610303 黄玉安

### Introduction

Base on Project 2, I add more code to generate intermediate code.

### Description

The major code is in directory `src/ir`, there are three part

- IRGenerator.h/cpp
- irnode.h/cpp
- optimizer.h/cpp

In `irnode.h`, it defined some class to represent the intermediate code, the class `IRInst` is used to represent one instruction in intermediate code, it use three address code (TAC) form.

In `IRGenerator.h/cpp`, it use visitor pattern to traverse the syntax tree which was generate in semantic part, to translate each of node to corresponding instruction. What is more, it also do some simple arithmetic calculation to calculate some expression value which is the first part of my optimization.

In `optimizer.h/cpp`, it check all the generated instruction  sequentially to optimized them. There are two part in them. The first part is to optimized some expression like the following form:

```assembly
a = 1 + p - p -9

// intermidate code
t1 = 1 + p;
t2 = t1 - p;
t3 = t2 - 9
a = t3
==> a = -8
```

And it will try to merge some expression, for example

```
t2 = t1
v = t2
==> v = t1
```

Besides, some label and jump instructions can be removed. This optimized code is in function `void IRGenerator::checkJumpLinks(IR *ir)` of file `IRGenerator.cpp`.

### Bonus Features:

You can use `make test` to generate intermediate code of all the test. 

You can use `make check` to get the result of c code of all the test.

You can use `make run`to run all these test to verify the running result.

I could translate struct, array (more than one dimension) and nested of using them. So I pass all the bonus test. And there are several other features I implement.

- #### Nested array and struct.

  My code support nested array and struct like:

  ```c
  struct O{
      int o1;
      int o2[3][4];
  }
  
  struct Operands
  {
    int o1;
    int o2;
    struct O o;
    int os[4][5];
  };
  ```

  The test is in: `nested_struct_array.spl`, you can use it to test  nested array and struct.

- #### Support continue and break statement

  I use two stack, `continueStack` and `breakStack` to let it support break and continue statement, if the two statements are not valid in that position, it will throw error.

  The test is `break_continue.spl`

- #### Support &&, || by using short circuit

  My code using short circuit to translate condition expression, the test is in `short_circuit.spl`

- #### Optimize empty if body

  There may be some case that two more label are neighborly which means the other label can be resolved. Moreover, it may be some situation that the statement body of if is empty, in that case, I could remove the whole condition expression of if statement.

  The test is `empty_if.spl`, just add a empty `if body` in `test_3_b02.spl`, so the result should be the same as it.

### Performance

I pass all provided test including require test, bonus test and two test (break_continue.spl, short circuit.spl) added by me. Here is the compare result of number of generated code and executed instructions between original code and optimized code. You can print generated code without optimization by command: `bin/splc [source file] -p -O0`. Default option is optimized.
