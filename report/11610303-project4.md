# CS323 Project 4 Report: Target Code Generation

### Introduction

Base on Project 3, I add more code to generate target code (specifically, MIPS).

### Description

#### Register Allocation Algorithm

I use the local Register Allocation Algorithm. First, I will find blocks of each function of three address code. Then I allocate register in each block. 

Here is how I find blocks.

- Every label instruction is the head of a new block.
- Every instruction followed in a jump (conditional/unconditional) instruction is the head of a new block.
- From one head until next head (do not contains next head) or to the end of three address code is a block.

After founding the block, before entering a new block, the status of all register are set fee. When exiting a block, all live variable will dump to memory.

In order to know the liveness of each variable, it need to analyze variable's information of being used in each block before generate MIPS code.

There is a filed `list<int> next_used` of each variable (corresponding to the `struct AddressDecriptor`) which recodes the line of instruction following that need to read this variable's value by using a list. By analyzing the use information from tail to head of one block, we can know the liveness of each variable.

```c++
struct AddressDescriptor {
    /** the reg that store this address's value now
     * may be null because they are in memory not in register currently
     */
    Reg *reg;
    /** the offset relative by current stack pointer ($fp), noticed that it is different
     * from $sp address
     * if it only appeared in register, then offset is negative
     */
    int offset;
    /**
     * default is false, true means the address is in the opposite of increased direction of $fp
     */
    bool forward = false;

    string name;
    list<int> next_used;
    };
```

By doing this, we at least need to three register to translate TAC instruction. The constant filed reg_number **control the number of register** we can use to store variable. In MIPS, it is 10.

```c++
class RegisterAllocator {
    static const int reg_number = 10;
    Reg temp_regs[reg_number];
    Reg static_regs[reg_number];
    Reg arg_regs[4];
    int fp_offset;
};
```

When allocate register, it will allocate a free register or dump the least recent used variable to memory and return this register.

```c++
Reg *RegisterAllocator::localAllocate(Mips *mips) {

    for (Reg &reg: temp_regs) {
        if (!reg.addr) {
            return &reg;
        }
    }
    Reg *spill = getRegByLru();
    AddressDescriptor *addr = spill->addr;

    if (spill->isDirty()) {
        if (addr->offset < 0) {
            addr->offset = getSpace();
            mips->push(4);
        }
        addr->saveToMemory(mips);
        spill->removeDirty();
    }
    addr->reg = nullptr;
    spill->addr = nullptr;
    return spill;
}
```

#### Optimized TAC

My compiler **directly read source code** file (.spl) and do some optimization during generate three address code. It contains:

- constant folding

  ```
  a := #1 + #2 ==> a := #3
  ```

- Eliminate computations

  ```
  a := #1 * b ==> a := b
  a := #0 + c ==> a := c
  ```

- merge instruction

  ```
  t := b 
  c := t // when t is a temporary variable ==> c := b
  
  t1 := 1 - p
  t2 := p + t1
  d := t2 + 1 // when t1 and t2 are temporary variable ==> d := #2
  ```

- Eliminate jump and label

  - If the jump (conditional/unconditional) target is the next instruction, then this jump can be eliminate.

  - If no instruction's jump target is this label, then this label can be eliminate.

    By applying the two rule above, it some times can eliminate if statement with empty body.

#### Generate Target Code

Simply write generate code for each type of TAC (branch, arithmetic).

Calling sequence is a little complex.

 **Caller part:** before calling

- save all variable status
- increase stack pointer
- save current $fp, $ra
- push argument

**Caller part:** After calling

- restore $ra, $fp
- restore all varible status
- get return value
- decrease stack pointer

**Callee part:** before executing first instruction

- update top stack pointer: move $fp, $sp
- get argument

**Callee part:** before return

- put return value
- decrease stack pointer: move $sp, $fp

### Conclusion

In this project, I finished a simple SPL compiler which generate MIPS code from source code. It is very challenge to write a good compiler, there are a lot of optimization work need to do which is very complex. Furthermore, there are not `malloc` and derivate type operation.
